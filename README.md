# Rails, Redis, & Postgres Case Study

Follow this course to see how Redis and Postgres can work together for high performance custom application development.

## Goals

Learn how Redis can help your relational database driven application performance.

## Getting setup

For this example we will be using Rails, Postgres, and Redis. Please follow the installation guide below.

1. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

2. [Rails on El Capitan](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan). We will be using Postgres, so you don't need to install MySQL in this guide.

3. Follow the Homebrew Postgres instructions in the above guide to install with or download the Postgres app for MAC [here](http://postgresapp.com/). I find the Postgres app to be very useful.

4. Install Redis with Homebrew with `$ brew install redis`. Then follow the prompt to start the server.

5. Clone this application and `cd` into the application directory.

6. From the application run `bundle install`
